# 📡 Network Monitoring Tool

## 🚀 Overview
The **Network Monitoring Tool** is a Python-based application designed to monitor network traffic, scan devices, and visualize network data. It is built using powerful libraries like **Scapy** for network analysis and **Pygame** for an interactive user interface (UI).  

This tool helps users to:  
✅ Monitor real-time network traffic.  
✅ Capture and analyze network packets.  
✅ Generate visual reports for better understanding of network data.  

---

## 📜 Features
- **Network Scanning**: Discover devices connected to your network.  
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Capture and analyze incoming and outgoing traffic.  
- **Packet Analysis**: Analyze network packets using Scapy.  
- **Data Visualization**: Generate interactive visualizations using Plotly.  
- **User Interface**: Easy-to-use graphical interface built with Pygame.  

---

## 🛠 Setup Instructions
Follow the instructions below to set up and run the **Network Monitoring Tool** on your local machine.  

### ✅ Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:  

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pattrick14/network_monitoring.git  
cd network_monitoring
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Switch to Root User (Optional but Recommended)
Since network scanning and packet analysis require elevated privileges, it's recommended to switch to the root user:  

```shell
sudo su root
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment
It’s always a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project:  

```shell
python3 -m venv env  
source env/bin/activate
```

This will isolate your project dependencies from your system environment.  

---

### ✅ Step 4: Install Required Dependencies
Now, install all the necessary libraries using the following commands:  

```shell
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install python3-pip  

pip install pygame scapy pandas plotly tkinterweb  
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

**Explanation of Packages**:  
- **pygame** → For GUI (User Interface) design.  
- **scapy** → For network packet sniffing and analysis.  
- **pandas** → For data processing and analysis.  
- **plotly** → For generating interactive data visualizations.  
- **tkinterweb** → For embedding web content within the application.  
- **python3-tk** → To enable tkinter GUI functionalities.  

---

### ✅ Step 5: Run the Project
Now that everything is set up, you can execute the project using:  

```shell
python3 networkmonitoring.py
```

The GUI interface will open, allowing you to monitor network traffic and analyze devices.  

---

### ✅ Step 6: Exit the Virtual Environment
Once you are done using the application, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:  

```shell
deactivate
```

## 📂 Directory Structure
The project is structured as follows:  

```
network_monitoring/
│
├── networkmonitoring.py   # Main application script
├── README.md              # Project documentation
├── requirements.txt       # List of dependencies (if created)
├── assets/                # UI assets like icons/images
└── data/                  # Captured network data (optional)
```

---

## 💻 System Requirements
Ensure that your system meets the following requirements:  
- **OS:** Linux (recommended) or Windows  
- **Python Version:** 3.8+  
- **RAM:** Minimum 2GB  
- **Network Access:** Required for network packet analysis  

---

## 📊 How It Works
The tool captures network packets using **Scapy** and processes them using **Pandas**. The data is then visualized using **Plotly** within the **Pygame GUI**. You can:  
- **Monitor live traffic** from your local network.  
- **Analyze packet information** such as source IP, destination IP, protocol, etc.  
- **Visualize traffic data** using interactive graphs.  

---

## 🔥 Important Notes
- **Administrator Privileges**: Certain features like packet sniffing may require **root access**.  
- **Firewall Settings**: Ensure that firewall rules allow the tool to access network traffic.  
- **Legal Use**: Always use this tool ethically and avoid unauthorized network access.  

---

## 📝 Troubleshooting
### 1. Error: `Permission Denied`  
If you encounter permission issues, ensure you are running the script as root:  
```shell
sudo python3 networkmonitoring.py
```

### 2. Error: `ModuleNotFoundError`  
Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly:  
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. GUI Not Opening  
If the GUI doesn't open, make sure `pygame` and `tkinter` are installed:  
```shell
pip install pygame tkinterweb
```

## 💡 Future Improvements
Some potential improvements for this tool include:  
- ✅ Adding real-time packet filtering.  
- ✅ Creating a log file for packet history.  
- ✅ Integrating email alerts for suspicious network activity.  
- ✅ Implementing device fingerprinting for unknown devices.
